# Portfolio Showcase
In this project, you will step into the shoes of a recent graduate who is looking for a job in the technology industry.
Project Scenario
You are a recently graduated information technology student and already have some related work experience. You want to showcase your skills, work experience, and qualifications to potential employers. To do this, you decide to create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You want to make decisions on the contents, presentation, user interactivity and then create the website. Potential employers will then be able to see your work in action. This will help them get a more concrete understanding of your skills and abilities.
Project Objectives
	1	Prove that you can integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a website
	2	Showcase other works that you have already done and other online presence
	3	Provide further information about your qualifications, references, and contact information
Your Challenge
Your task will be to create a professional website that showcases your qualifications, work experience, work samples, and other online presence. To do this, you will make design decisions, outline the content, and then create your website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In this project, we'll use Visual Studio Code; however, to keep this project unique and open-ended, please feel free to choose whichever text editor or integrated development environment that you prefer.
After you completed your project, you will share your reflections.
